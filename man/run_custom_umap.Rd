\title{Run UMAP with Custom Parameters}
\usage{
run_custom_umap(data, neighbors, min_dist, n_epochs = 200)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A matrix or dataframe of numeric values where rows represent samples
and columns represent features.}

\item{neighbors}{An integer specifying the number of neighbors to consider
for each point in the UMAP algorithm. Higher values result
in capturing broader patterns, while lower values capture finer details.}

\item{min_dist}{A numeric value indicating the minimum distance between points
in the UMAP embedding. Smaller values keep similar points close,
while larger values increase separation.}

\item{n_epochs}{An integer specifying the number of training epochs for UMAP.
The default value is 200. Higher values may improve stability
of the embedding at the cost of computation time.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with two columns (\code{UMAP1}, \code{UMAP2}) representing the
UMAP embedding coordinates for each sample.
}
\description{
This function performs Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)
on the input data, allowing customization of UMAP parameters, such as the
number of neighbors, minimum distance, and the number of training epochs.
}
\details{
The function allows for flexible UMAP configurations to be used
with distance-based input. It leverages \code{umap.defaults} as a base
and overrides specific parameters based on function inputs.
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
# Assuming `data_matrix` is a matrix of distances or a high-dimensional dataset:
run_custom_umap(data = data_matrix, neighbors = 15, min_dist = 0.1, n_epochs = 300)
}
